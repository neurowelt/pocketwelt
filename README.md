# pocketwelt

Python powertool in your pocket :hammer:

## Introduction

`pocketwelt` purpose is to provide some basic tools for Python projects.

Idea for this package came from my personal experience of repeating certain methods over and over again - quite simple, but yet too complex to keep them in my memory at all times.

Hopefully `pocketwelt` will help you as it helps me - as a pocekt tool that comes in handy when I want to kickstart development as fast as possible or simply forgot about simple base64 encoding ;)

Worth noting - package uses only built-in Python libraries. My purpose is to keep this as vanilla as possible, so it does not collide with other dependencies you might have in your project.

## Installation

`pocketwelt` is available on [PyPi](...) and you can install it via pip:

```bash
pip install pocketwelt
```

You can also install it straight from git:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/neurowelt/pocketwelt.git
```

## Notes

When going through the `tests` directory you will find [a painting of Gandalf](./tests/test_image.png) (see [original](https://www.jefmurray.com/gallery/)) that I use for testing. It was created by Jef Murray, a reknown fantasy illustrator. I recommend visiting his [site](https://www.jefmurray.com/gallery/) to see more of his work.
